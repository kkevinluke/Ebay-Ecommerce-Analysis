# Ebay-Ecommerce-Analysis
This data science project aims to perform analysis on cars listed on ebay.
First an API call using the "Ebay finding API" was used to extract real time data from Ebay. 
After this we upload the extracted data to a database "Postgres" using a data pipeline and perform our EDA. 
The results and findings are then published on a report with graphs, visualizations and interpretations.
